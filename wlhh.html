                        <p>The app Numi was created to solve one of the biggest questions of everyone's every day. "What's for dinner" Nymi App will show you the various options that you can cook. It is a one-stop solution for finding what to eat and how to make it with minimum effort.</p>
                        <p style=" font-style: italic;"><b>Team:</b> Amanda Kim, Gabriel M.Martino, Jakob Wollin, Shemesh Rajan</p><p> We were four members of a team. My role in the Group was to do User Research. However, we all were involved in each of the activity was conducted during the Project.</p>
                        <p><b>Tools we used for projects sucess:</b> Discord, Slack, Trello, Zoom, Miro, Pencil & paper, Google suite, Figma, Invision, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator</p>
                        <p><b>Timeline:</b> 3 weeks</p>

                            <p>As user research, according to our objective, we wanted to understand why people have trouble deciding what to eat or make for a meal. 
                            Our assumption was that because of the busy routine, people were unable to accomplish the grocery shopping and therefore they had to order their food online.
                            To uderstand Sara (Proto Persona) more, we conducted interviews and took a survey. The data allowed to organize and analyze the user research result. Our major finding was:</p>
                            
                            - Over half of respondents got takeaway at least once a week.<br>
                            - The vast majority of users want to cook more meals at home.<br>

                            
                        <p>
                            Our assumptions were validated regarding user behaviors towards cooking through our User Interviews</p><br>
                            
                            <p>Our key takeaways were:</p>
                        
                            <p>Users want to cook more meals at home.</p>
                            - shared pain point is not knowing what to cook.<br>
                            - Convenience is the most important factor for users when deciding what to eat.

                        <p>The interview and the survey data showed below points, where we used the affinity diagram method to get deeper insight into our users.<br>
                            - Convenience was the most important factor for users in their decision-making process.<br>
                            - Users generally want to eat better and spend less on takeaway food, but are frustrated with having to devise options to cook<br>
                            - AR Ingredient scanning marries the ability to discover recipes with convenience for a user.<br>
                            
                            We use the method “I like.., I wish.., What if..” to prioritize our tasks that help to solve the problem for the user.</p>

                        <h2 style="color:#ffb633;">Prototyping(low-hi) </h2>
                            <p>We had a few competitors analysis to understand our competitors. We made some low-fidelity flow for our user on paper and created a clickable prototype to test the Idea. As per the feedback, we started developing the low-fidelity prototype.<br>

                             <p>During the wireframing process, our team realized the key features which we wanted to focus on were the AR camera, my profile, my ingredients, and search results display.</p>
                                
                            <p>We wanted to focus on these features as we believed they are key in helping users in their process of inputting ingredients, searching for recipes, and finding results.</p>
                                
                            <p>As an outcome of this, we decided to create a prototype that effectively utilised these features to help improve the user’s experience within the app.</p>

                        <p>User Testing was the most intresting part. Through four structured tasks, testing the Numi app exposed several key elements for the team to develop further and iterate.<br>
                            <p>The top three of them were as below.</p>
                            <p>• Make the AR scanning feature more obvious<br>
                            • Add text to buttons on scanning screen<br>
                            • Notifications and visual feedback when completing certain tasks</p>
